        - Red Dot Visibility Issue on Declined Notification:
            - Identified the issue and removed the delay in the destroy API.
            - Found that the delay caused the notification not to update when declined.
            - Began debugging the issue using event delays in Celery.
            - Utilized the Django debugger to find a solution.

        - Debugging Notification APIs**:
            - Debugged the `partial_update` for "mark as read" and `destroy` for "deleting the notification".
                - Found that removing the delay from the `destroy` API resolved the issue, making it work perfectly.
                - Created PRs for both development and production (CD-435-dev).
