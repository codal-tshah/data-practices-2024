        - Red Dot Visibility Issue on Declined Notification:
            - Identified the issue and removed the delay in the destroy API.
            - Found that the delay caused the notification not to update when declined.
            - Began debugging the issue using event delays in Celery.
            - Utilized the Django debugger to find a solution.
