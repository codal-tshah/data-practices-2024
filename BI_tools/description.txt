            - add symbol to files 
            - save the csv files in local only

            - do swap the position of columns
            - changing column name 
            - do check the datatypes and change it accroding to the need
        
        - redshift warehouse :
            - make a table with applying , dist and short keys
            - make date as primary key 
            - load the csv data from s3
            - perform query if needed to analyze insights
        
        - Tableau
            - connection of redshift to Tableau
            - set up data model 
            - make insights
