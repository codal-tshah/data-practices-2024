AWS Redshift Overview
    Data Warehouse: AWS Redshift itself acts as a data warehouse where you can store and analyze large volumes of data.
    Storage: Data is stored in Redshift tables, not directly in files like CSV. You load data into these tables from various sources (e.g., S3, RDS, etc.).
    Querying: You perform queries on data stored in these Redshift tables, not directly on files.

21_may:
- we use copy command to load data because it works as a mpp(multiple parallel processing thing), insert queries runs and iterate line by line and take more time rather than copy job breaks in multiple parts and do load the data parallely.

- Types of Distribution Styles
    AUTO: Redshift decides the distribution style.
    KEY: Data is distributed based on the values in one column.
    ALL: A copy of the entire table is distributed to every node.
    EVEN: Data is distributed evenly across all nodes.

- SORT KEYS: 
    Sort keys determine the order in which data is stored. They can significantly speed up queries that use range-restricted predicates, such as those involving BETWEEN, <, <=, >, and >=.
    - Types of Sort Keys
        COMPOUND: Multiple columns are sorted in the order specified. Good for queries that filter on the leading columns.
        INTERLEAVED: Columns are equally important for sorting, and Redshift can quickly filter on any combination of the specified columns.
